    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    Working and studying in ICT8 was sometimes a pain in the butt but some times it was really fun.there were many early mornings where I had to come to school early. 
    But in the end it was all worth it because now I know how to use so many different types of sites and apps on the computer that I didnt even know existed a month ago.
    I really enjoyed making this website I think it was one of my favorite things to make in ICT8. It was a really enjoyable way to finish of this ADST course.I think I found making the 
    the video game the most difficult because of all the coding and sites. But because I did all that this webpage feels more familiar. I would like to start learnig more about 
    making websites and and powerpoints it is really fun to be able to customize your own project to make it feel like your own. I am definetly going to use all of these things
    like excel worksheets and powerpoints for my futre job and resumes and all of that stuff for when im grown up. Over all I really enjoyed ICT8 and I wish to learn 
    even more in th futre.
