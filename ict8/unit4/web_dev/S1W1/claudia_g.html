      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a grade 8 student at Sutherland Secondary. I am an only child, and live in Canada. I love doing many sports like horse riding, volleyball, gymnastics, ext. My favourite colour is baby blue or pink, but it changes often. I also love Starbucks and shopping a lot too!

  <h2> Reflection</h2>
  <p>After finishing ITC8 I hve learned so much, from the basic skills of the computer, to diving into coding and game making. I really enjoyed everything but one in particular has really stood out to me, game making. I had so much fun making my little shooter game and by the end I was able to actually piece together code and add things by myself. However, even though this was my favorite unit it was also the hardest for me. There were many complicated steps and had to be precise, though I am thankful I worked through it because I had such a great outcome. I also enjoyed the other units like Essential skills because without it I would be completely lost and will forever use those skills in the future. Digital media and web making were also great, and I have had so much fun and learned so much. One thing i would love to learn more about is the backbones of the computer and all the skills in between. I feel that having computer techie skills is extremely helpful and that is one area that I am definitely lacking in. I will forever use these skills in the future and in any job or schoolwork I could have. This was a great class, and I would definitely take it again.   </p>
