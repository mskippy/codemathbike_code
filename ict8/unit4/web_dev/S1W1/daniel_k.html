      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>ICT 8 Final Reflection 

U1: I enjoyed learning about the computer parts the most. What I found most challenging was doing the file management. What I would like to learn more about is learning the parts of a computer because when I get enough money i want to build my own gaming pc and I need to know about computer parts for that. A way I could use this information in the future is if I take another computer class in grade 9 or higher, and if I build a computer, which I will probably do. 

U2: I enjoyed learning about the meme tracker because we got to watch videos on YouTube, and we also got to work with excel which was easy for me. 

What I found challenging was the unit 2 final project and I made it about AI. It took me a while to finish it. 

I would like to learn more about how ai is not good. 

I might use the excel skills that I learnt in the future if I work in a job where i need to use computers. 

U3: I enjoyed adding the enemy because it added a challenge to the game. I found making the enemys spawn quite challenging. I would like to learn more about the features of gdevelop. I might use this in the future if I want to make a game and I want to use an easy-to-use game engine. 

U4: what i enjoyed most was adding the pun. 

What i found challenging was getting the image. I would like to learn more about what html can do. 

I can use this in the future to make a website. </p>
