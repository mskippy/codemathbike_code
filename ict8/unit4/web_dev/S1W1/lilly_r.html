      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I have many hobbies inculding chrochet, boxing, reading, sculpting, and lacrosse. I really like movies ranging from comedy to action, and documentumerys. I spend most of my free time crocheting, I taught myself how to crochet with nothing to help me but youtube videos, and now its not really a hobby but an obession.

<section><h2>Reflection</h2></section>
<p><body>I enjoyed a lot of things about this class but my overall favourite thing was being able to build a game; I have never done that before and It was a great experience as well as very informative. I really liked creating the players in my game because of the great feeling of accomplishment when I completed the player and what the player was able to do. What I found most challenging was when we first started this class and we had to create folders with links and files; I had never done this before and I was quite a bit lost, but over time I was able to understand how to do it, and then we started to build the game and I thought nothing was harder to do then learn how to create folders and files, and download, but I was wrong. I would like to learn more about coding and building a game, this goes back to what I said about adding stuff to make the game more challenging. I would like to learn how to make levels, different enemy health and player health for each level, and difernet objectives for each level. I talked a lot about levels but I would also like to learn how to create my own design of players and enemys, basically just building off what I have compleated already. I will most likely use the information I gained on files, and downloading information and saving it to files. I also feel I will use the information I learned about on AI misninformation, beacse of how important it is becoming in todays society, as well as being able to use excel and powerpoint with a higher difficulty level.     </body></p>
