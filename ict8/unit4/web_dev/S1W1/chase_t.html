      <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
      <p>In the first unit it was kind of boring since all we did was put files in folders. But hey I did learn how to do it. And the main challenge was to organize the folder because I kind of suck. What i would like to learn more about in this unit is how many folders I can put in a folder with the folders having folders inside of them. How i will use this new skill in the future is by just organizing nothing. </p>
      <p>Unit 2 we learned how to find fake information and how to check if the information is real or not. This unit was the most use full for me because unlike other units which I might not ever use I really use. The challenge I had with this unit was making the poster. </p>
      <p>Unit 3 my favorite unit is making a game by somewhat scratch. The easiest part was adding objects like the player and enemy. But the hardest part was coding in the enemy to spawn since I messed up there, and micro errors will break the entire code. </p>
      <p>Unit 4 making a website. The challenge I had with this website was putting in the joke since I didn’t know how to change the answer before a friend told me. The easiest part though was adding my name into the website </p>
