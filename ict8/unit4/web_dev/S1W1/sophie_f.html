      <h1>Hi, I'm <span id="studentName">Sophie</span> 👋</h1>

      <h2>About Me </h2>
      <p>Im a twelve year old tween who enjoys the outdoors, rock climbing, and watching shows. I spent 4 years of my life doing kickboxing, until i dropped out for rock climbing. I have a cat named sugar, and she throws up a lot, but thats okay... she's also killed 2 birds from our balcony and brought them to me as a little christmas present.

      <h2>Relfection</h2>

        <p>This class was slightly painful at times, but it definitely bumped up my skill level with computers... and probably my level of patients. It shows the amount of joy when you get something correct after working on something for what feels like HOURS! But its also not a good feeling when you're working on code and you misspell something slightly, or dont add a capitol and it ruins the whole thing and drives you to endless madness. Using canva were the EPIC days when I did a colour coded resume of my favourite childhood cartoon character. I also enjoy reminiscing about the glory days when we were making paper cranes from a youtube tutorial and had EXTRA TIME to make an extra paper dragon. Another genuinely painful experiene from this class was one of the first days when we learned how to use our files and i had a major headache for a good number of hours. But thats okay. It doesnt happen anymore... I MIGHT be able to use this information in the future when I have to make spread sheets and all that pizzazz as an adult. And presentations I suppose... Coding will probably useful at some point, although I'd rather not do it as a job or hobby. And, of course, writting my own resume or online profile should helpful in my adult life as an accomplished human being!</p>
