      <h1>Hi, I'm <span id="studentName">Ruby C</span> 👋</h1>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since i grew up, i've always played soccer and did kickboxing since i was little. I've done both sports since i was 4 and im not the biggest fan of kickboxing anymore because my soccer is 4 times a week plus a gym thing my coach started up. So, it's a lot for me and that's why i want to stop kickboxing. Another fun fact about me is that my comfrt places is defintely vacation spots! It makes me feel so relaxed and calm! I've always one to Maui, Hawaii and its beautiful there! I did go to Mexico Last summer and i hope to go again beasue i loved it there and it was just so peaceful! Lastly, a course goal for this class was to learn on how to do brand new things on a computer and to have fun!

      <h2>Course Reflection</h2>

      <p> Something i enjoyed most about this course is probaly using excel and canva becasue i got to learn new things and how to use it. I did know how to use canva, but excel was a brand new thing for me and i found it very entertaining. The game development was my most challenging one because it was hard for me to undertsand the insructions. Something i want to learn more about is ai, i do know a lot about it but it would be really fun if i learnt brand new things about it that not many people know about it. i could defiently use computers in the future because my job might use this techology. If i ever have a job that uses laptops then this will be ver helpful to me, because i will know how to works apps. i did enjoy digitl literacy and essential skills, because it was very entertaining and somewhat easy to me. Overall, this course was really fun to me and i had so much fun helping and doing my own work!
