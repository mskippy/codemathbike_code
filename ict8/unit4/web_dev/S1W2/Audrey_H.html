      <h1>Hi, I'm <span id="studentname">Audrey H </span> 👋</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my first webpage for ICT 8. I built this in VS Code using HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Audrey H And i was born on april 25 2012, I like to play sports, draw, go outdoors or to the beach, and hangout with friends. I play soccer, volleyball, and swimming and i am going to try out for the basketball team.I also like to listen to music and go on runs. A fun fact about me is that I went to late french emmersion in grade 6 for an extra challenge. For this class I want to acheive the ability to work well on a computer and maybe in the future be able to make another game with less instructions to follow.

      <h2>Course Reflection</h2>

      <p>In essential skills u1 I enjoyed learning the basics of the computer and improving my typing abilitys. I was very challenged by the parts of the computer and i still dont really know where to find and name all of the buttons and ports.With these skills in the future I can know my way around using a computer and help friends and family with their technological needs. I found that u2 Was a lot of work but the work was like a medocre challenge, and the thing I found the hardest was managing my time at school and at home so I could finish all of the things in this unit. I enjoyed makiung the resume about myself and the fake news posters. In u3 game developement I learned how to make a funcioning video game that i cant play. I found it challenging to understand the intructions and apply them to my game but after i understood the little details i got the hang of it. In U4 i thought it was really fun to make the webpage. My favourite part was changing the background and text colours and also adding the photo. I found it challenging to understand which part of the code to adjust and which parts to keep the same.  </p>
