      <h1>Hi, I'm <span id="studentName">Joshua F</span> 👋</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my first webpage for ICT 8. I built this in VS Code using HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      
        One of my favorite things to do is to play soccer, which I have been playing for 8 years. I also like playing video games and getting rest after school because school takes to long. 
        Fun fact im from Peru, not Mexican, Indian, or Arabic. My goal for this course is to pay attention to class  and get good grades!

      <h2>Course Reflection</h2>

      <p>In Essential Skills & Digital Literacy I learned how to type faster, better, and more efficient because we started practicing in a typing website and I think I really improved. A challenge I found in Essential Skills & Digital Literacy was to get used to having both hands in the center of the keyboard to type. I handled this by trying my hardest to master this skill and improving day by day by practising every day. 
In Digital Media I learned how to use a word, excel, and Canva to create cool, fancy documents with well structured sentences. A challenge in Digital Media was to know the little shortcuts and tricks to make it easier to type well structured documents. Next time I would do some research to be ahead in class to hand in the documents on time. I handled this by being on task paying attention and doing some research before classes.
In Game Development, I learned how to make videogames because of GDevelope which helped me a lot. A challenge in Game Development was to be able to make my code work next time I would plan and really pay attention to the instructions so I can fix any bugs. I handled this by asking for help from the teacher or y fellow classmates.
In Web Development, I learned how to make and edit code and even create a website because we used VS code to make it happen and instructions from our teacher."
A challenge I faced in Web Development was being able to edit the code because of how complex it was. Next time I would watch a YouTube tutorial to understand code more effectively. I handled this by asking my peers and teacher for help if I needed it.
