      <h2>Course Reflection</h2>

      <p>Essential Skills: I found this unit really challenging beacuse i was really lost on what was happening, but after a little bit i found my way and i actually starded enjoying it, also making files and folders and naming stuff was challenging. I also liked making the AI posters. 
        
      Digital Media: In digital Media i learned about making powerpoints and canva which ive done before but its always good to mastered things and making posters about Ai was cool and getting to learn about Ai was fun to, and this is something that i will do in the future 
    
    </p>Game Development: Game Development was really fun beacause i got to make my own game fro the first time in my life and it was really hard making the character and how the game runs but in the end i found it pretty good  and i would want to do again someday
    </p>: Game Development was really fun beacause i got ot make my own game fro the first time in my life and it was really hard making the character and how the game runs but in the end i found it pretty good  and i would definitely want to do again someday in the future

    Web Development: This was the hardert unit for sure i was really confuzed with this unit because i never did something like this and i didnt know what to do most of the time i was asking for help beacuse i was confuzed with the work given
