        <h2>Congrats! 🎉</h2>
        <p>You’ve built a working Space Shooter. Now let’s <strong>fix rough edges</strong>, <strong>polish the feel</strong>, and <strong>add new mechanics</strong> to make it truly fun.</p>
        <p>This is a <em>modular</em> assignment: Complete Part A then pick and choose which parts to implement based on your skill level and time. The <strong>Reflection</strong> section at the end has questions about your design choices.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Part A — Fix-It Pass</h2>
      
        <h3>Must-fix bugs / tweaks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bullets vs meteors:</strong> When player or enemy bullets hit a meteor, delete the bullet (optionally damage/destroy meteor).</li>
          <li><strong>Game flow messaging:</strong> Add a <em>“Get Ready!”</em> overlay at the start and a <em>“Game Over”</em> screen/scene when health ≤ 0.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed balance:</strong> Tune player, bullet, enemy, and meteor speeds to feel fair.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Assets Audit</h3>
        <p>Open your <code>Assets/</code> folder and list what else you can use right now—no new downloads needed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Extra SFX (shoot, hit, explosion, pickup), background music loops.</li>
          <li>Alternate enemy/player sprites, meteor variants, background images.</li>
          <li>HUD icons (hearts/shield), fonts, pickup art.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Quick Audio Pass</h3>
        <p>Add essential sound so actions feel responsive. Keep levels comfortable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SFX:</strong> play on <em>shoot</em>, <em>enemy hit/explosion</em>, <em>player hit</em>, <em>pickup</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Music:</strong> loop a quiet background track; stop/duck it on Game Over.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixing tips:</strong> SFX slightly louder than music; avoid clipping; reuse one or two channels for similar sounds.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <details>
          <summary>GDevelop hints (audio)</summary>
          <pre><code>// Fire SFX when shooting
      On press FireButton:
        Audio → Play a sound: Assets/sfx/shoot.wav (volume ~70, not looped)
      
      // Enemy destroyed
      When Enemy is deleted:
        Audio → Play a sound: Assets/sfx/explosion.wav (vol ~80)
      
      // Pickup
      On collision Player with Pickup:
        Audio → Play a sound: Assets/sfx/pickup.wav (vol ~65)
      
      // Background music (scene start)
      At the beginning of the scene:
        Audio → Play a music file: Assets/music/loop.ogg (looped, vol ~35)
      
      // Game Over
      When PlayerHealth ≤ 0:
        Audio → Stop all sounds and music
        // or: Audio → Set global volume to 0, then show Game Over
      </code></pre>
        </details>
      
        <h4>Polish checklist</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Controls feel responsive; collisions make sense.</li>
          <li>HUD is readable (no edge clipping/overlap).</li>
          <li>Core SFX + music are working and well-balanced.</li>
        </ul>
      

      </section>
      

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Part B — Power-Ups &amp; Pickups (Depth)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Health pickup:</strong> Increase <code>PlayerHealth</code> on collision, then delete the pickup.</li>
          <li><strong>Shield pickup (timed):</strong> Set <code>PlayerHasShield = true</code>, start timer, ignore damage while true; add a ring animation for feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Stronger lasers / fire-rate boost:</strong> Temporarily increase <code>BulletDamage</code> or reduce <code>FireCooldown</code>, then revert.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Stretch:</em> A pickup spawner that appears every X seconds at a safe random position; use rarity tiers.</p>
        

      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Part C — Enemies, Meteors &amp; Pacing (Fun)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gradual escalation:</strong> Track <code>DifficultyLevel</code>; every 20–30s, increase spawn rate or variety.</li>
          <li><strong>Waves:</strong> Spawn enemies in waves; brief pause between waves; show “Wave 2”.</li>
          <li><strong>Caps &amp; spacing:</strong> Limit concurrent enemies (e.g., ≤ 8) to avoid instant swarms.</li>
          <li><strong>Meteor fields:</strong> Occasional clusters players must weave through.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Stretch:</em> New enemy types with different speeds, health, and behaviors (e.g., zig-zag, kamikaze).</p>
 
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Part D — Score Systems (Motivation)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High Score:</strong> Save and load with Storage actions so the best run persists across sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Combo / streak (optional):</strong> Bonus points for quick consecutive kills; reset on damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Score pop-ups:</strong> Small “+10” BBText near destroyed enemies for satisfying feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Stretch:</em> Different points for different enemies; bonus for completing a wave without damage.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Part E — Feel &amp; Feedback (Juice)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Particles:</strong> Small burst on hits/explosions.</li>
          <li><strong>Camera screenshake:</strong> Very subtle shake on big hits.</li>
          <li><strong>Animation states:</strong> Player flash while shielded/damaged.</li>
          <li><strong>Sound mix:</strong> Balance volumes; distinct pickup chime.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Stretch:</em> More particle effects (thrusters, pickups); dynamic music intensity based on difficulty.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> What was the hardest technical or creative problem you solved in GDevelop? What helped you break through that challenge?</li>

          <li><strong>Player Experience:</strong> Think about how your game feels to play (controls, difficulty, pacing, feedback). What specific decisions did you make to create a fun or satisfying experience?</li>

          <li><strong>Testing & Iterating:</strong> What’s one bug, imbalance, or design issue that you fixed that made the biggest improvement to your game?</li>

          <li><strong>Creative Growth:</strong> What did you discover about yourself as a designer or creator during this project? (e.g., patience, creativity, problem-solving, attention to detail, persistence)</li>

          <li><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> If you had one more week to work on your game, what feature or improvement would you add next — and why would it matter to the player?</li>

        <h2>Quick GDevelop Snippets (pseudocode)</h2>
        <pre><kbd>// Bullet vs Meteor
        IF PlayerBullet collides with Meteor
          → Delete PlayerBullet

        // Get Ready overlay
        At scene start:
          Show GetReadyText
          Disable PlayerControls
        After 1.0 sec:
          Hide GetReadyText
          Enable PlayerControls

        // Shield (5 seconds)
        On collision Player with ShieldPickup:
          Set PlayerHasShield = true
          Reset timer "Shield"
          Delete ShieldPickup

        IF PlayerHasShield = true AND Timer "Shield" &gt; 5
          Set PlayerHasShield = false

        // Ignore damage while shielded
        IF PlayerHasShield = false AND Player collides with EnemyBullet
          PlayerHealth -= 1
          Delete EnemyBullet

        // High Score
        On scene start:
          Storage → Read "HighScore" into HighScore (default 0)

        On Game Over:
          IF PlayerScore &gt; HighScore:
            HighScore = PlayerScore
            Storage → Write "HighScore" = HighScore
