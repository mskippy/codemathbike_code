          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p><strong>Big idea:</strong> Thoughtful cinematography makes your story clearer, more engaging, and easier to edit. Good footage starts with planning, teamwork, and careful shot composition.</p>

          <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use core cinematography concepts such as <strong>camera angles, framing, rule of thirds, headroom, and lead room</strong>.</li>
            <li>Apply basic lighting techniques using <strong>natural light</strong> and the idea of <strong>3-point lighting</strong>.</li>
            <li>Record clearer audio using <strong>lav mics</strong> or built-in mics in quiet environments.</li>
            <li>Capture useful <strong>B-roll</strong> and <strong>establishing shots</strong> for your edit.</li>
            <li>Film responsibly by respecting <strong>privacy, safety, and consent</strong>.</li>
            <li>Begin filming and organizing your project footage in a clear folder structure.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>You should have completed:</strong> your project <strong>pitch</strong>, <strong>script</strong>, <strong>storyboard</strong>, and <strong>shot list</strong> from the previous lessons in Unit 4.</p>
        </section>

                <!-- Planning Your Production – Individual vs Group Tracks -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>Planning Your Production – Choose Your Track</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone will create their <strong>own finished video</strong>, but you might work
            <strong>individually</strong> or as part of a <strong>group</strong>. Use the track below
            that matches how you are working. Both tracks still lead into the same
            <strong>Key Concepts</strong>, <strong>Camera Lab</strong>, and <strong>filming activities</strong>.
          </p>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Track A – Individual Filmmakers</strong> (solo project)</summary>
            <div>
              <h3>1. Confirm Your Solo Project</h3>
              <p>
                You already have your <strong>pitch, script, storyboard, and shot list</strong>.
                Before filming, quickly review and update them so they match:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Where you can realistically film (locations)</li>
                <li>Props and materials you actually have</li>
                <li>How much time you have for filming in and out of class</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>2. Identify Your Support Team</h3>
              <p>
                Even if you are the only person making your video, you still need help with things like
                <strong>holding the camera, checking framing, or acting</strong>.
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>List <strong>1–2 classmates</strong> (or your teacher) who can help with filming.</li>
                <li>Decide what you might ask them to do (camera, acting, quick feedback).</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>3. Solo Production Outline</h3>
              <p>
                In your existing pre-production document, add a short
                <strong>Solo Production Outline</strong> section that includes:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Main filming locations (e.g., kitchen, classroom, outside bench)</li>
                <li>Filming schedule (in-class filming days + any extra time)</li>
                <li>List of props/materials you need and who provides them</li>
                <li>Any privacy/safety notes (e.g., “don’t film other students in the background”)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4. Get Ready for Activity A</h3>
              <p>
                Choose a <strong>short part of your video</strong> (about 10–30 seconds of finished time)
                that you will practice in the Camera Lab:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>For example: introducing materials, a key step, or the final reveal.</li>
                <li>Mark 3–5 shots in your shot list that you will test different angles for.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You’ll practice these specific shots in Activity A so the footage can be used in your final edit.
              </p>

          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><strong>Track B – Group Filmmakers</strong> (shared theme, individual videos)</summary>
            <div>
              <h3>1. Establish a Group Theme</h3>
              <p>
                As a group, agree on a <strong>shared theme</strong> that connects all of your videos, while
                still allowing each person to make their own version.
              </p>
              <p><em>Examples:</em></p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li><strong>Baking Basics</strong> – cookies, bread, cupcakes</li>
                <li><strong>Study Hacks</strong> – planners, note-taking, organizing binders</li>
                <li><strong>Sports Skills</strong> – serving in volleyball, shooting in basketball, passing in soccer</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>2. Map Individual Ideas to the Theme</h3>
              <p>
                Each group member must still have a <strong>unique video idea</strong>. In a shared document,
                record for each person:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Video title</li>
                <li>1–2 sentence description</li>
                <li>What makes it different from the others (subject, recipe, perspective, location, etc.)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>3. Create a Shared Pre-Production Document</h3>
              <p>
                Make a copy of the <strong>Pre-Production Template</strong> and rename it:
                <code>GroupName_PreProduction_Shared<>.
              </p>
              <p>Use it to track:</p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Group theme + list of group members</li>
                <li>Shared locations (where you are allowed to film)</li>
                <li>Shared props/materials and who brings them</li>
                <li>Shared equipment (tripod, lav mic, lights, etc.)</li>
                <li>Rough filming schedule (who needs the camera when)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4. Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
              <p>
                Add a simple table or list of <strong>rotating roles</strong> in your shared document so everyone
                knows how they are helping on filming days:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Camera operator</li>
                <li>On-screen presenter</li>
                <li>Audio check / “quiet on set”</li>
                <li>Props/materials manager</li>
                <li>Director (framing, lighting, shot quality)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                You can switch roles between scenes so everyone gets practice.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Update Individual Documents</h3>
              <p>
                Once the shared plan is clear, each person should quickly update their
                <strong>own</strong> pre-production documents (script, storyboard, shot list) so they match:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>The agreed locations and times</li>
                <li>Shared props/equipment</li>
                <li>The final version of their unique video idea</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>6. Get Ready for Activity A</h3>
              <p>
                As a group, choose a <strong>short shared sequence</strong> that everyone will film in their own way
                during the Camera Lab (for example, “introducing materials” or “first key step”).
              </p>
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Each student will film their <strong>own version</strong> of this moment.</li>
                <li>The group can help each other with framing, lighting, and retakes.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The goal is to come out of Activity A with <strong>usable clips</strong> for your real videos, not just practice footage.

          <h3>1. Framing &amp; Composition</h3>
          <p>
            Use the <strong>rule of thirds</strong>, <strong>headroom</strong>, and <strong>lead room</strong> to make your shots look intentional, not random.
            Remember:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li><strong>Rule of thirds:</strong> Place important subjects on the grid lines or intersections.</li>
            <li><strong>Headroom:</strong> Leave a bit of space above a person’s head—don’t crop them off.</li>
            <li><strong>Lead room:</strong> Leave space in front of where a person is looking or moving.</li>
            <li><strong>Angles:</strong> Wide (context), medium (actions), close-up (details/emotion), over-the-shoulder (instructions/conversations).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>If you’re a visual learner, watch this quick breakdown of rule of thirds, headroom, and lead room before you start filming.</em></p>

          <h3>2. Lighting Essentials</h3>
          <p>
            Good lighting makes your video easier to see and more professional. Start simple:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li><strong>Face the light:</strong> Don’t put your subject in front of a bright window.</li>
            <li><strong>Key light:</strong> Main light on one side of the face.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill light:</strong> Softer light to reduce harsh shadows.</li>
            <li><strong>Back light:</strong> Light behind the subject to separate them from the background.</li>
            <li>A single bright window + a room light can mimic <strong>3-point lighting</strong> if you position carefully.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>If your shots look dark or “muddy,” watch this demo to see how simple 3-point lighting can improve your video.</em></p>

          <h3>3. Audio Basics</h3>
          <p>
            Viewers will forgive slightly messy video, but <strong>bad audio loses them fast</strong>. Aim for:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li><strong>Quiet environment:</strong> Turn off music, fans, or open windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Get the mic close:</strong> Use a lav mic if you have one, or move the camera closer.</li>
            <li><strong>Do a test recording:</strong> Record 5–10 seconds and listen back before filming everything.</li>
            <li>Use soft surfaces (curtains, clothing, carpet) to reduce echo.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>If you’re not sure how to place or hide a lav mic, this short video shows you the basics.</em></p>

          <h3>4. B-Roll &amp; Establishing Shots</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A-roll</strong> = main talking parts. <strong>B-roll</strong> = extra footage that shows details, actions, and the environment.
            B-roll keeps your video interesting and helps you cover up cuts or mistakes.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li><strong>Establishing shots:</strong> Wide shot of the room/kitchen/workspace at the start.</li>
            <li><strong>Detail shots:</strong> Hands mixing, tools, ingredients, close-ups of important steps.</li>
            <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Slow pans, tilts, or push-ins to add energy.</li>

          <h3>5. Responsible Filming – Privacy &amp; Consent</h3>
          <p>
            When you film, you’re not just making a video—you’re also handling other people’s privacy. In our school projects:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Ask permission before filming anyone who might be recognizable.</li>
            <li>Avoid filming random students in the background if you can.</li>
            <li>Follow school rules about where you are allowed to film.</li>
            <li>Don’t post classmates online without their consent (and parent/guardian permission for minors if required).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Before you film in hallways or public spaces, pause and think about who might end up on camera and whether you have their permission.</em></p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
          <h2>Activity A – Project-Based Camera Lab: Shot Composition Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            In this camera lab, you are not filming random test shots. You will practice
            <strong>real shots from your own video project</strong> so that what you film today can
            be used in your final edit.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1 – Choose a Short Sequence from Your Video</h3>
          <p>
            With your group, pick <strong>one short part</strong> of your video (about 10–30 seconds
            of finished video time). For example:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Explaining the ingredients you’ll need</li>
            <li>Showing a key step in the process (e.g., mixing, assembling, or cutting)</li>
            <li>Introducing the finished product or result</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Look at your <strong>script, storyboard, and shot list</strong> to decide which moment to focus on.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 2 – Film Multiple Versions of the Same Shots</h3>
          <p>
            For your chosen sequence, each person should film <strong>multiple versions</strong> of the
            same shots, using the cinematography ideas from this lesson.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Each student films at least:</strong></p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>
              <strong>1 Establishing shot</strong> of the location/workspace  
              <em>(try at least 2 angles – wide from different positions)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1 Medium shot</strong> of the main action  
              <em>(try 2 versions – different angles or slightly different framing)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1 Close-up shot</strong> of an important detail  
              <em>(try 2 versions – different angles or distances)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1 B-roll / creative shot</strong>  
              <em>(e.g., slow pan, over-the-shoulder, low-angle, or movement shot)</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While you film, pay attention to <strong>rule of thirds, headroom, lead room, lighting,</strong>
            and <strong>audio</strong>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 3 – Compare Shots and Choose the Best Ones</h3>
          <p>
            Now it’s time to compare and get feedback.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>
              <strong>If you are in a group:</strong>  
              Sit together and watch each person’s clips for the same shot type (e.g., everyone’s
              establishing shots). For each shot type, decide:
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Which version looks the most professional and why?</li>
                <li>Which framing feels clearest for the audience?</li>
                <li>Does the shot use good lighting and avoid distractions?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>If you are working mostly on your own:</strong>  
              Ask <strong>1–2 classmates</strong> or your teacher to quickly watch your clips and answer:
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Which version would you choose for the final video?</li>
                <li>What could I change to improve the framing or lighting?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 4 – Save Your Best Clips in a Camera Lab Folder</h3>
          <p>
            After you get feedback, choose your strongest clips and save them in a clearly named folder.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Create a folder called <code>CameraLab_FirstName<> inside your project folder.</li>
            <li>Rename your favourite clips clearly, for example:
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li><code>Establishing_Desk_01.mp4<></li>
                <li><code>Medium_Mixing_02.mp4<></li>
                <li><code>CloseUp_Ingredients_01.mp4<></li>
                <li><code>Broll_PourIntoPan_01.mp4<></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Optional: keep extra versions in a folder called <code>Extras<> if you might still use them.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>By the end of Activity A:</strong> you should have several <strong>usable, well-composed clips</strong>
          that fit your actual video project, not just practice shots.</p>
        </section>

                <!-- Activity B – Begin Filming Your Project Footage -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>Activity B – Begin Filming Your Project Footage</h2>
          <p>
            Now that you’ve practised your shots in the Camera Lab, it’s time to start filming
            <strong>real footage</strong> for your video. The goal of this activity is to capture
            your main <strong>A-roll</strong> (talking/explaining) and start building a library of
            strong <strong>B-roll</strong> (supporting visuals).
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1 – Set Up Your Project Media Folder</h3>
          <p>
            Create a folder for this project so your footage doesn’t get lost on your device.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Create a main folder named: <code>Unit4_Footage_FirstName<></li>
            <li>Inside it, create subfolders:
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li><code>Aroll<> (your main speaking/instruction clips)</li>
                <li><code>Broll<> (detail shots, process shots, environment)</li>
                <li><code>Audio<> (only if you record sound separately)</li>
                <li><code>Extras<> (any test clips you might still use)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Track A – Individual filmmakers:</strong> this folder holds all of your own clips.<br>
            <strong>Track B – Group filmmakers:</strong> each person still has their <em>own</em> folder,
            even if you filmed together.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2 – Film Your A-Roll (Main Talking Parts)</h3>
          <p>
            Use your <strong>script</strong> and <strong>storyboard</strong> to film the main parts
            where you explain, demonstrate, or talk directly to the audience.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Film in a <strong>quiet location</strong> with good lighting.</li>
            <li>Use the framing rules from this lesson (rule of thirds, headroom, lead room).</li>
            <li>Record <strong>more than one take</strong> of important lines or steps.</li>
            <li>After each short section, pause and check that:
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Your voice is clear and loud enough.</li>
                <li>Nothing important is cut off in the frame.</li>
                <li>There are no major distractions in the background.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Save each clip in your <code>Aroll<> folder with clear names, e.g.
              <code>Aroll_Intro_01.mp4<>, <code>Aroll_Step2_02.mp4<>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>If you’re in a group:</strong> rotate roles (camera operator, presenter, audio check)
            so everyone gets experience and support.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3 – Film Supporting B-Roll</h3>
          <p>
            Now capture the visual details that will make your video more interesting and easier to edit.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Use your <strong>shot list</strong> to guide which B-roll you need.</li>
            <li>Film close-ups of hands, tools, ingredients, or important steps.</li>
            <li>Grab one or two <strong>establishing shots</strong> of your workspace or environment.</li>
            <li>Include at least one <strong>movement shot</strong> (slow pan, tilt, or push-in).</li>
            <li>Let the camera roll a little longer than you think you need
              (2–3 seconds before and after the action).</li>
            <li>Save these in your <code>Broll<> folder with clear names, e.g.
              <code>Broll_HandsMixing_01.mp4<>, <code>Broll_FinishedProduct_01.mp4<>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> If someone is helping you film, remind them what you want the audience
            to notice in each shot (e.g., “focus on the texture of the dough”).
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4 – Daily Wrap-Up: Review &amp; Fill the Gaps</h3>
          <p>
            Before you finish for the day, take 5–10 minutes to review what you filmed.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Quickly skim through your <code>Aroll<> and <code>Broll<> folders.</li>
            <li>Check for:
              <ul class="list-tight">
                <li>Clips that are too dark, too noisy, or badly framed.</li>
                <li>Important steps or moments that are missing.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Highlight or mark missing shots on your <strong>shot list</strong>.</li>
            <li>Make a short note for next class: “Next time we need to re-film…”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Optional but smart:</strong> back up your footage to OneDrive, Teams, or a USB drive
            so you don’t lose your work if something happens to your device.
          </p>

          <p><strong>By the end of Activity B:</strong> you should have a mix of <strong>A-roll</strong> and
          <strong>B-roll</strong> saved in your project folder, ready to be organized and edited later.</p>
        </section>

                <!-- Filming Checkpoint – Before Production -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>Filming Checkpoint – Before You Start Production</h2>
          <p>
            Before moving on to editing (production), you must confirm that you have enough
            <strong>good-quality footage</strong> to build a strong video. Editing only works when
            you have lots of options — different angles, different takes, and enough B-roll to
            cover transitions and mistakes.
          </p>

          <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Professional filmmakers always <strong>film everything first</strong> before they even
            open their editing software. Editing is much easier when you have:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li><strong>Multiple takes</strong> of the same moment</li>
            <li><strong>Different angles</strong> to choose from</li>
            <li><strong>Extra B-roll</strong> to make your video engaging</li>
            <li><strong>Clean audio</strong> for every section of your script</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you start editing with not enough footage, you’ll waste time, get frustrated, and
            have to go back and re-film. This checkpoint prevents that.
          </p>

          <h3>What You Must Have Before Production</h3>
          <p>
            Use this checklist to make sure you’re ready to start editing.
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>
              <strong>A-roll:</strong> All main talking and demonstration clips filmed, with at least
              <strong>2 usable takes</strong> of important moments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>B-roll:</strong> Enough detail shots, close-ups, process shots, and establishing
              shots to cover your entire script.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clear audio:</strong> No loud background noise, wind, or echo on important lines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multiple angles:</strong> At least 2–3 different angles for key steps so your edit
              doesn’t look static.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Organized folders:</strong> A-roll and B-roll saved neatly into your project folder
              with clear filenames.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shot list check:</strong> You’ve marked which shots are done and which ones still
              need to be filmed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backup:</strong> Your footage is backed up to OneDrive/Teams/a USB device.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Quick Self-Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            Answer these before moving on:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-tight">
            <li>Do I have more than one take for important scenes?</li>
            <li>Do I have B-roll for every major step or moment?</li>
            <li>Would someone who hasn’t seen my script understand the video from my footage?</li>
            <li>Could I begin editing today without needing to re-film?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Teacher Check-In</h3>
          <p>
            Show your teacher your <strong>Unit4_Footage_FirstName</strong> folder and your updated
            shot list. Once your footage is confirmed, you will be cleared to move on to
            <strong>production (editing)</strong> in Lesson 4.4.
          </p>

          <p><strong>This is your green light:</strong> You are not allowed to begin editing until
          this checkpoint is complete.</p>
